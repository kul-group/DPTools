Installation
============

DPTools requires and assumes that DeePMD-kit_ with the LAMMPS_ package has already been installed.

.. note::
    Ensure that your installation of DeePMD-kit includes LAMMPS built with the DEEPMD package! 
    A simple :code:`pip install deepmd-kit` is **NOT** sufficient, as LAMMPS will not be installed or configured properly.

The most straightforward way to accomplish this is by using conda...

.. _DeePMD-kit: https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepmd-kit
.. _LAMMPS: https://lammps.org
